# AI and Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my AI-Data-Science-Journey repository! I am an AI developer specializing in the field of medical image and signal processing, with 6 years of academic and professional experience. Over the years, I've noticed that I want to review some concepts that I've forgotten and also learn new things. This repository is my way of documenting these learnings for myself, and I would like to share it with everyone so that it might help others.

In this repository, you will find detailed documentation, code samples, and practical guides on a wide range of topics and tools used throughout the AI and Data Science lifecycle. This includes aspects of project management and technical implementation that span the entire process from initial development to final deployment.

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of everything I've learned and implemented in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, covering various phases of a project including development, build, release, deployment, and more.

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute as I continue to update this repository with new insights and techniques. Let's embark on this Data Science and Analytics journey together!
